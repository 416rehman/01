# 32bit-Hardware-Chipset
Collection of digital logic gates for circuit design constructed from NAND.

## How to use

Install [Nand2Tetris for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=roblourens.vscode-nand2tetris-hdl)
to open the .hdl files, and use the Nand2Tetris's Run Code feature to test the logic for a circuit (tests defined in .tst, and correct results in .cmp)

You can also use the online [falstad circuit simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/) to run the .circuitjs.txt files to simulate the circuits.

## Circuit Designs
These are some of the designs implemented using the falstad circuit simulator, the logic for these can be found in the corresponding `.circuitjs.txt` files.
