# 32bit-Hardware-Chipset
Collection of digital logic gates for circuit design constructed from NAND.

## How to use

Install [Nand2Tetris for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=roblourens.vscode-nand2tetris-hdl)
to open the .hdl file and use Nand2Tetris's Run Code feature to test the logic (test defined in .tst, and correct result in .cmp)

You can also use the online [falstad circuit simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/) to run the .circuitjs.txt files to simulate the circuits.
